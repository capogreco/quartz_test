Unfortunately I could not award you marks for using boolean logic in this submission.  You will have an opportunity to demonstrate the use of boolean logic in your next assignment task.

Comments were quite good, although please format your comments so they do not line wrap and make your code look messy.

Please use white space and abstractions such as functions and variables to keep your code both neat and consistent.  If you are using semicolons at the end of lines, this should be consistent through your code.  Tidy code should be a pleasure to read.

The submitted composition did a good job of rendering its effective complexity in a cute register.  I feel there may have been a missed opportunity by not using any sound design elements.  In the context of a really minimal composition like this, I feel that colour of the background could have been more carefully chosen to maximise cuteness.

Your blog is good!  Please make sure you are using links to help your reader access the materials and examples you are discussing: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links

The work lands very well within a cute register.  My feeling is that a sound design element may help potentiate the cuteness already contained within this composition.

Blog was very good!  Please put homework from each session in its own blog post, and be careful to read each question in the homework tasks carefully.

You can afford to use more white space to help your code be more readable.  Also take care to keep your code comments from being too long and needing to line wrap.

The submitted composition did a good job of rendering its effective complexity in a cute register, although I feel there may have been some missed opportunity to include a sound design element.  Also, there may have been an opportunity here for you to make the shapes bounce off each other, which may have helped the complexity present in the work land in a more strongly cute register.

Be careful to write your comments in such a way that they are not in danger of wrapping to the next line.

The use of colour and simplicity helped this work land in an aesthetic register.  My feeling is you may have been able to better potentiate the cuteness here by dialing back some of the complexity rendered by the thin outlines of the cube.  I really like the effect, but for me this places the work in a more chaotic register, than cute.  Also, there may have been a missed opportunity here to include some sound design element.

The blog was very good.  Be careful not to miss opportunities to include links to help the reader access the materials under discussion.

Unfortunately I was not able to award you any points for including *** in this submission. You will have an opportunity to demonstrate *** in the next assignment task.

Please keep comments short and format them such that they do not need to wrap to the next line.

Please reach out to me via email or discord. if you are having trouble with the homework tasks. It is my expectation that you will complete the homework tasks and post documentation of your process and final result, along with some discussion about how the experience was relevant to you as a critical, creative practitioner  
  
Please resize embedded examples to be appropriate dimensions, and use syntax highlighting in your fenced code blocks. Also, using more headings and subheadings may help structure your blog, and please link to the content you are discussing so that the reader can access it easily.
