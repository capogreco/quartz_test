1 - Consider [_I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS_](https://lauren-mccarthy.com/I-heard-TALKING-IS-DANGEROUS), by [Lauren Lee McCarthy](https://lauren-mccarthy.com/)  In what way could you consider this project to:
- be an example of [mycelial creativity](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/134185/files/38048816)?
- belong to the [aesthetic category](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/134185/files/38048845) of interesting?

2 - Brainstorm ideas regarding what community of practice you might engage with for your [AT3](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/134185/assignments/941531) project.  Please include:
- its domain
- its shared values
- its existing repertoire
- how you might broker some creative coding repertoire to this new context

In teams of 2 or 3, use [flok.cc](https://flok.cc) to do a collaborative live-coding performance that uses:
- [hydra](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/134185/pages/hydra) for visuals,
- [strudel](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/134185/pages/strudel-and-tidalcycles) for audio,
... and which goes for between 6-24 minutes. 

Take a screen recording of the performance, upload to YouTube, and embed in a blog post, with some discussion detailing:
- what aspects of the process were frustrating,
- what aspects of the process were rewarding,
... and what you think the live-coding community are trying to do, and why.

## wk 11
Drawing on today's in-class discussion, and this week's readings, please write a blog post which answers the following question:
