There was an opportunity with this assignment to be more adventurous with your underlying concept.  I would like to see you wielding the conceptual structure of your creative intention more boldly in future submissions. 

Your use of an immediate L cut into the coffee machine worked well!  The rest of the montage suffered from not being given the same treatment - the opportunity here is to use L-cuts throughout the sequence to help the emotional flow from shot to shot feel natural and avoid the stilted effect that can happen when the visuals and audio cut together.

Similarly, there was an opportunity to use the timing of your cuts to give more structure and contour to the emotional flow of your montage.

Please make sure you are completing the homework tasks and documenting your process in your blog, along with some discussion about how the experience relates to you as a critical, creative practitioner.

Generally good use of transitions, music, and pacing to imbue a continuous emotional flow across your montage.  Some moments could have used some more attention: the frying pan sound, for example, could have used some slower crossfades.

I liked the jump-cuts of you reading in different positions.  This is a classic trope, and it was quite effective at communicating something about your identity as a creative practitioner.

Please be careful to post documentation of all the homework tasks, along with some discussion about how the experience relates to you as a critical creative practitioner.  What did you get out of the activity that you can apply to your creative practice?  What were you frustrated or surprised about?
