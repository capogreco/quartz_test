Finally, we concluded with this, the Press Space I added because when you commit that action of pressing space, I showed a still image of a green image or green background. I want to add a green colored background because I think it would calm the user down because green is the color of refreshing, of the color of lives with ree, a green space for user to calm down after looking at that crazy glitching screen. To add another texture, I added sounds to the code as well, when you click space bar, it will plays the bird chirping. I managed to get it when you clicked back from the green to the static glitch screen,which I found it was even more chaotic. 

Step 4: Final word
The process of making this was back and forth, I decided and have attempted to make a fractal tree but I don't like how it turned out to be. Luckily, glitch effect have so much areas to explores and during the process of making this, I have learnt a lot and with mistakes as well. I still believe there are a lot of areas that I can work on to make this code more interesting, I have tried to fix most of the mistakes and add more value for this one. I am happy with the result and looking forward to your opinion about this. See you on the next assignment.
