## Introduction: Art in the Expanded Field

> In the pages that follow, I attend specifically to the ways that dialogic, socially oriented, and research-based art practices are remade within the university-as-site. (p 2)

- [[dialogism]]
- [[university]]


> ... Lacan's 1964 lectures on the gaze as *objet petit a* ... (p 2)

Possibly referring to [[Lacan]]'s [[Seminar XI - The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis]]


> I do this toward a vision of a university not in ruins ... a university of creativity, experiment, and what I will frame in the pages to come as a mode of eros that is committed, cathected, and sustaining. (p 3)

- [[eros]]
- [[cathexis]]


> It is for the insertion of voices and practices into the academic everyday that work to trouble disciplinary relays of knowledge / power, allowing for more creative, sensually attuned modes of inhabiting the university as a vibrant location of pedagogical *mattering*. (p 3)

- [[Mattering]]


> "Practice-based research is an original investigation undertaken in order to gain new knowledge partly by means of practice and the outcomes of that practice." (p 5)

- from the Creativity & Cognition Studios' ["Research" page](https://www.creativityandcognition.com/practice-based-research/)


> ... these are definitional debates that matter not to the making of research-based art in general, but rather to the use of artistic forms and methods as *the rendering public (publishing) of research* within a university context. (p 5)

- [[rendering public]]


> In this context, it seems to me that, in very many ways, giving "art" the status of "research" does little more than echo early feminist interventions in to the canon that took the form of "add women and stir" - a tokenistic gesture of inclusion that does nothing to change the logics that structure these exclusions in the first place. (p 6)

Implicitly: what is the purpose of research-creation?  Are we simply a marketing device?


> ... my focus is ... on what research-creation does *in*, *to*, and *as part of* ongoing university discourse in the arts, humanities, and social sciences ... (p 7)

Again, implicitly: why do research-creation?  What is its role here at the university?


> ... I mobilise research-creation as a mode of resistance to individualist, careerist, and bibliometric university cultures. (p 8)

- [[bibliometrics]]
- [[resistance]]


> ... when the dialogic and pedagogical start to be used as artistic *material*, the university becomes both a site of institutional critique and an exploratory playground. (p 9)

- [[dialogism]]
- [[pedagogy]]
- [[artistic material]]

- Bourriaud, Nicolas, _[[relational aesthetics]]_ (Les Presses du réel, 2002)
- Kester, Grant H., _Conversation Pieces: Community and Communication in Modern Art_ (University of California Press, 2013)
- Kwon, Miwon, _One Place after Another: Site-Specific Art and Locational Identity_ (MIT Press, 2004)

Could we not say that [[distributed synthesis]] uses the [[internet]]  as its [[artistic material]]?  And is the internet not exemplary of "the dialogic and pedagogical"?


> ... research-creation is very much entwined with *endogenous* drives in contemporary art practice, theory, and history. (p 10)

- [[endogenous discourse]]

Research-creation as a constructive collision of discourses.


> This worry is set up as a structure in which the value of one term (*research*) will necessarily eclipse the other (*art*). (p 11)


> The way that the arts have historically been devalued in the academy at large mimics the structural relation of art maker to art thinker in the discipline of art history itself, which too often presumes that artistic practice, while it can be seen as a vehicle for research or thinking with the capacity to seriously *impact* rather than only *express* or *reflect* social experiences and issues, still fails the benchmark of rigour and accountability to which academics hold themselves. (p 12)

- [[academic rigour]]


> It is in the context of such perspectives that research-creation programs can be seen as particularly potent locations from which to reassess and reconfigure how we, in the overlapping fields of art, art history, and visual culture, understand our subjects, objects, and methods of study and publication. (p 12)

Research-creation can reconfigure how we understand things, ie. what can be parsed / rendered intelligible.  Ie. it acts on the set of implicitly held commitments necessary for concept / language use
- [[primeval sense of correctness]]


> ... at the doctoral level, artistic production is no longer solely an *object* of scholarly inquiry but is itself legitimate *form of research and dissemination*, which in turn raises questions regarding the book-length monograph as the only legitimate product of a dissertation in the arts and humanities (p 12-13)

- [[propositional knowledge]]


> ... pedagogical ideologies - regimes of truth - configure the parameters of legitimate research questions as well as what counts as rigour or excellence, for both student and teacher. (p 13)

- [[regimes of truth]]


> ... this first chapter offers stories of pedagogy, of art, of research, and of the intertwined pressures that we face in the neoliberal university today - pressures that affect not only our capacity to keep up with ever increasing service and administrative loads, but, linked to this, our very capacity to speculate, dream, and imagine otherwise. (p 14)

- [[creative horizon]]


> As Henry Giroux (2013) writes in his persuasive op-ed piece in *Truthout*, "Not only does neo-liberalism undermine both civic education and public values and confuse education with training, it also wages war on what might be called the radical imagination." (p 113)

- Giroux, Henry A., ‘Public Intellectuals Against the Neoliberal University’, _Truthout_, 2013 [link](https://truthout.org/articles/public-intellectuals-against-the-neoliberal-university/)


> ... chapter 3, "Polydisciplinamory", offers the beginning of a theoretical framework fro the research-creational approach presented thus far. ... by drawing on the affective literacies of theoretical polyamory. (p 14)

- [[polydisciplinamory]]


> ... psychoanalytic theory is my friend, helping me to theorise research-creation as a method attentive to cathexis and situated curiosity in ways that necessarily tumble out of the frame of the monodisciplinary. (p 15)

- [[cathexis]]
- [[halting problem]]
- [[monodisciplinary]]


> ... the objet petit a, in this chapter, becomes a figuration that helps put desire and drive centre stage in the research-creational game. (p 15)

- [[objet petit a]]
- [[desire]]
- [[drive]]
- [[research-creation]]


> ... the objet petit a ... is what we are in the grip of when we find ourselves pushing our projects into disciplinary and formal directions that we don't yet know how to justify. (p 15)

- [[justification]]

Ie. when we are using our [[feelings]] to navigate a network of implicit conceptual relations without the guidance of explicit [[propositional knowledge]].


> There is no longer any question that we are living in compromised times, within which the fantasy of an uncompromised self is isolationist, privileged, and dangerous (Shotwell 2016). (p 16)

- Shotwell, Alexis, _Against Purity: Living Ethically in Compromised Times_ (University of Minnesota Press, 2016)

Not only does the [[Vitruvian man]] not exist, but the illusion of rationality, independence, etc. implied therein actively shields our complicity from scrutiny.


> The arts ... offer modes of sensuous, aesthetic attunement, and work as a conduit to focus attention, elicit public discourse, and shape cultural imaginaries. "How might the world be organised differently?" is a question that matters urgently, and it is a question that art - particularly art attuned to human and more-than-human social justice - asks in generative and complex ways. (p 16)

- [[endogenous discourse]]
- [[primeval sense of correctness]]


> ... if we understand research-creation as an approach to bringing academic and artistic tools together in more-than-disciplinary ways that challenge the current hegemony of the book-length monograph as the only legitimate outcome of a PhD in the arts and humanities, then it does, indeed, need a critical discourse that exceeds the parameters of disciplinary legitimation. (p 17)


> ... it invites us to think beyond this form, to denaturalise it, and ask ourselves how we might, each, engage in remaking and reshaping our institutions by bringing artistic literacies, modes, and approaches to bear on the wicked problems that surround us ... (p 18)


## 1: Haraway's Dog

> ... stories are "wondrous things.  And they are *dangerous*" (King 2003, 9; emphasis added).

- ‘The Truth about Stories: A Native Narrative’, dir. by Thomas King, CBC Massey Lectures (CBC, 2003)

There is [[music]] in the *telling* of a story, a [[primeval sense of correctness]] that the audience must become complicit in if they are to "get" it.  
- In order to be powerful in this way, the story must imply [[prosody]], even on the page.
- What the story offers, as opposed to a mere argument, cannot be summarised or given in any less words.
	- [[Kundera]], Milan, _The Curtain: An Essay in Seven Parts_, Reprint edition (Harper Perennial, 2007)


> ... King invites us to think about stories as material-semiotic events that impact - indeed, configure - worlds. (p 21)

- [[monism]]
- [[configuration]]
- [[worlds]]


> King invites us to be attentive to which stories *we are crafted out of* as well as which we participate in crafting; which stories we teach, and which stories we are taught by. (p 21)

The role of storytelling in assigning to us the commitments that come to constitute our subjectivity.
- As [[Kant]], via [[Brandom]], contributes: we are constituted by our commitments.


> For King, the relation of storyteller to story-listener conditions which stories are whose to tell and when, producing stories not only as sites of knowledge but as ethical relations. ... Both frame these intertwined sensorial relations as productive of *stories that matter*. (p 22)


The telling of a story entwines [[propositional knowledge]] and [[ethical relations]] (normative commitments), in a process of *[[mattering]]*.

> What King and Haraway ask, each in their own way, by mobilising different stories in different ways, is that we seriously attend to and recognise the constitutive power of the stories through which we come to understand the world, and, when necessary, give our all to reorganise them. (p 22)

We must a) understand this relationship and b) try to fix things when there is a problem here.


> Importantly, within both King and Haraway's texts, it is *curiosity* that emerges as key to our capacity to make such changes. (p 22)

- [[curiosity]]


> ... Haraway suggests that to "find arguments and stories that matter to the worlds we might yet live in" (3) we must investigate, with the curiosity of she-who-does-not-already-know, the material-semiotic entanglements, the "worldliness" out of which each of us, at any given moment, emerges. (p 23)

- Haraway, Donna Jeanne, _The Companion Species Manifesto: Dogs, People, and Significant Otherness_ (Prickly Paradigm, 2003)
- reminiscent of [[Ingold]]'s [[mycelial people]]
- [[monism]]


> ... "contained within creation stories are relationships that help define the nature of the universe and how cultures understand the world in which they exist" (p 23)

- a [[primeval sense of correctness]] that allows content to be rendered intelligible
- [[creation story]]


> One of the first of these stories os the story of Charm, who creates the world cooperatively with nonhuman others, almost, it seems, by accident.  The story begins with Charm digging a hole so deep that she falls through it ... (p 23)

- the [[halting problem]]


> In a similar vein, Melissa K. Nelson's "Getting Dirty: The Eco Eroticism of Women in Indigenous Oral Literatures" (2017) tells stories of Star woman (241) and Sky woman (254) digging, both refusing cautions, and both embodying the driven power of erotic, feminist curiosity. (p 114)

- Nelson, Melissa K., ‘7 Getting Dirty: The Eco-Eroticism of Women in Indigenous Oral Literatures’, in _7 Getting Dirty: The Eco-Eroticism of Women in Indigenous Oral Literatures_ (Duke University Press, 2017), pp. 229–60, doi:[10.1515/9780822373162-008](https://doi.org/10.1515/9780822373162-008)
- [[creation story]]


> ... the *driven* version of curiosity that King ascribes to Charm takes over her very sense of self such that her actions are no longer volitional but are constitutive: she doesn't make them; *they make her*. (p 23)

- it is [[drive]] that fastens our commitments
	- [[Lacan]]'s [[Kant with Sade]]
- Charm is constituted by her commitment to *find out*.
- Charm's commitment to find out (to *dig through the frame*) instantiates her as [[Turing-complete]], with [[interoperability]], ie. contiguous with [[technē]].


> It is just such a curiosity that, taught by Haraway and King, I would like to claim as central to the approach to research-creation for which this book argues. (p 23)

Research-creation is a constitutive commitment to digging through the frame.


> At the end of his book, echoing many a poststructuralist theorist, King draws on the words of poet and novelist Jeanette Winterson to assert that language is not something we speak; *it speaks us* (King 2003, 2). (p 24)

- King, Thomas, _The Truth about Stories: A Native Narrative_, 3rd ed. edition (University of Minnesota Press, 2008)
- Lacan says a similar thing about "language users" being used by language in [[Seminar XVII - The Other Side of Psychoanalysis]]


> ... *the crafting of a research question is the crafting of a story that is also the crafting of an ethics*. (p 24)

- [[research question]]
- [[ethics]]


> ... research-creation as a methodology that, therefore, *necessarily* side-steps disciplinary allegiance. ... rather than letting our research questions be conditioned by the structures of legibility and value ... we must take seriously King's call to *tell stories differently* and pair this with our own versions of the questions that Haraway asks herself: "Whom and what do I touch when I touch my dog?" and"How is 'becoming with' a practice of becoming worldly?" (2007, 3)(p 25)

- In telling stories differently, are we summoning a kind of [[ironism]]? Ie. attending to the ways in which the vocabulary established by mono-disciplinarian creation stories trap us in a holding pattern?
- What do I touch when I touch javascript?


> "so ... what is *your* dog?" (p 25)

Is javascript my dog? ... distributed synthesis?


> Together we discovered that to frame a research question in this way helped to unpin it from a primarily disciplinary orientation ...

- stay as close as you can to the material.


> ... *it placed the curiosity-driven question first*.  What these texts modeled for us was an approach to research rooted in process, multiplicity, context specificity, and contingency - one that might even be called *emergent*.

- [[emergence]] 


> This term - *emergent* - is peppered throughout *Companion Species*, and it is often paired with *symbiogenesis*.  The terms rhyme conceptually.  While *symbiogenesis*, forwarded by the evolutionary theorist Lynn Margulis (1967), speaks to the relational origin of organisms (an understanding of the contested distinction *species* as emerging through symbiosis rather than mutation), *emergence* describes an aggregate property of elements, none of which demonstrate that property inherently within them.

- [[symbiogenesis]]
- [[emergence]]
- Sagan, L., ‘On the Origin of Mitosing Cells’, _Journal of Theoretical Biology_, 14.3 (1967), pp. 255–74
	- Sagan ^ may be Margulis' married name?


> Emergence is relevant to research-creation  ... because it refigures disciplinary research objects in ways that invite us to think interdisciplinarity-as-emergence: as productive of outputs that exceed what is demonstrably present in their constituent parts.  (p 26)

> ... this complexity is not simply a failure that adequate perspective ... might correct (what Haraway has called a *God trick* (1988, 582), the view of everything from nowhere), but rather that complexity is the *name of the game*, whether we are talking turtles (King 2003), elephants (Haraway 2003, 12) or metaplasm (54); it is "stories about stories, all the way down." (p 26)

- the unconscious is structured like a language
- the Real comes to us already in conceptual form
- Haraway, Donna Jeanne, _The Companion Species Manifesto: Dogs, People, and Significant Otherness_ (Prickly Paradigm, 2003)
- [[God-trick]]

> ... eros figures something that is conditional (in the sense of being *situated*) and that is both critically unknown and unknowable (in the sense of being *emergent*): " ... one cannot *know* the other or the self, but must ask in respect for all of time who and what are emerging in relationship, is the key" (50). (p 26)

- Could we risk positing Eros, as a marker of situated-ness, to be a necessary condition for emergence?

> ... Haraway's caring must be erotic in order for it to be ethical. (p 27)

- Lorde, Audre, ‘The Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power’, in _Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches_ (Crossing Press, 2007), pp. 53–59


> ... it is in allowing ourselves to be drawn by our loves, our intensive and extensive curiosities, attentive to what and whom we are *driven* to explore, and examining the complex web of relations that we inherit thereby, that we might inhabit research questions ethically. (p 27)

> Agape, in its unconditionality, its lack of situated attention-to-the-conditions-that-are-the-case, fails "to fulfill the messy conditions of being in love" (Haraway 2003, 35) - a love that is both driven and non-innocent. (p 27)

> The Aristotelian framework Haraway is drawing on here maps onto the psychoanalytic only if we read Haraway's eros as aligned with the Freudian death drive and agape with the Freudian life drives. (p 116)


> In other words, when in love-as-eros, the story is never told; it is always in the process of unfolding ...

- [[ironism]]: no final vocabulary
- When you know someone with a capital K, you are, in a sense, ready to kill them.
	- Avital [[Ronell]]


> True love (eros) leads, as Haraway models for us, to true curiosity - to truly *driven* curiosity.  The kind of curiosity that lends itself well to the "drive" that psychoanalysis thinks with; the kind of curiosity that can get one into trouble, and that forces one to try and figure out how, in Haraway's idiom, to *stay with* that trouble. (p 27)

> ... a research-creational approach insists that it is to our deepest, doggiest, most curious loves that we are beholden, and that it is love - eros - that must drive our research questions as well as our methodological toolkits. (p 28)

> ... an ethical structure of research cannot, if we understand the ethics at stake here to be something expressed in the form of Haraway's love for her dog(s) or Charm in her digging, be given *first and foremost* by discipline. (p 28)

> ... research-creation, as a "problem-oriented" modality, puts situated curiosity - troubling and troublesome, erotic curiosity - at the helm. (p 29)

> " ... Interdisciplinary study consists of creating a new object, which belongs to no one" (72). (p31)

- Barthes, Roland, _Mythologies_, trans. by Annette Lavers (Hill & Wang Pub, 1973)


> A boundary object *does things with disciplines*, satisfying certain of their requirements, without, however, belonging properly to any one of them. (p 32)

- [[boundary object]]

> In some ways, it is an *in-coherent* object. (p 33)

The mere presence of a boundary object agitates the primeval sense of correctness (that set of normative commitments which constitute its context, and which are responsible for rendering its intelligibility).


> It promiscuously inhabits all of these spaces, speaking to each, resisting being fully claimed by any one disciplinary location while being nonetheless legible across all of them. (p 33)

> ( ... research-creation as something that hovers ambivalently between "art and not-art: and "research and not-research"). (p 37)


> ... challenge the norms of those fields, producing boundary objects that insist on being undutiful. (p 37)

- Gunkel, H., C. Nigianni, F. Soderback, and Kenneth A. Loparo, eds., _Undutiful Daughters: New Directions in Feminist Thought and Practice_, 2012th edition (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012)


> ... research-creation, thus figured insists that curiosity, in all its erotic pluripotency, be its guide, pushing us to tell new stories in the academy, stories that denaturalise singular disciplinary locations while nomadically claiming space within all of them; ...

- Braidotti, Rosi, _Nomadic Subjects: Embodiment and Sexual Difference in Contemporary Feminist Theory, Second Edition_ (Columbia University Press, 2011), p. 352 Pages


## 2: Discipline(s)

> ... as Felman tells it, rather than functioning as a deterrent, the storekeeper's prohibition (like Badger's warning to Charm) works not to quash but to *ignite* her curiosity. (p 39)

- Felman, Shoshana, _Jacques Lacan and the Adventure of Insight: Psychoanalysis in Contemporary Culture_ (Harvard University Press, 1987)
- [[prohibition]]
- [[curiosity]]


> ... Felman asks us to shift our pedagogical habits from a practice of searching for the known or knowable, the manifest content of a reading practice, to a reading (and research) practice that is attentive to the aesthetic, excessive dimensions of knowledge.  She invites us to cathect not only the content of (in this case) the Lacanian text, but its poetic, excessive, and difficult *form*. (p 39)

- [[form]]
- [[cathexis]]


> To work interdisciplinarily, on this reading, is to attend to *who* is producing knowledge and *how* that knowledge is being produced in ways that defamiliarise and reorient discipline from *identity* to *act* - to a thing one *does* rather than a thing one *is* (Foucault 1978) (p 40)

- Foucault, Michel, _The History of Sexuality. Volume 1, An Introduction_ (Allen Lane, 1979)


> As Bill Readings suggests, in his prescient *The University in Ruins*: our job, here, is to orient ourselves toward "not a generalised interdisciplinary space but a certain rhythm of disciplinary attachment and detachment, *which is designed so as not to let the question of disciplinarity disappear, sink into routine*" (1997, 176; emphasis added). (p 41)

- [[interdisciplinarity]]
- Readings, Bill, _The University in Ruins_ (Harvard University Press, 1996)


> Research-creation, taken as critical interdisciplinary praxis, asks us to attend to how we habitually justify our research through disciplinary stories, those that we tell and those we have been told along the way. (p 41)

- [[research-creation]]
- [[creation story]]


> ... it asks us to question whether writing, on a page, in an article or book format, is, indeed, the appropriate, most effective, persuasive, or interesting way to "write" our research. (p 41)

- If (for example) the problem is that it has become impossible to point words at the right thing, would dance, with its ability to *index*, not be a more useful intervention?


> ... as long as all adjudicating members are willing to listen when a colleague from a neighbouring field explains why what may seem banal from the perspective of one field is, in fact, important, even innovative, to another. (p 41)

- [[interdisciplinarity]]


> ... art does not make conclusive, defensible arguments and therefore cannot be, strictly speaking, research; art ... *fails* if it communicates too didactically, too clearly, and thus cannot function as scholarly research ... (p 44)

- [[propositional knowledge]]
- [[Kundera]] makes a similar point about the art of the novel, in [[The Curtain]]
- I don't buy [[Natalie Loveless]] 's argument here.  I think she makes two mistakes:
	- she implicitly reinforces the notion that context independent propositional knowledge is not only possible, but the university's raison d'etre
	- she undervalues the contribution art makes by implicitly impacting what can be rendered intelligible within a given context


> ... it is also to question our very understanding of the work of the university. (p 45)

- [[university]]


> ... and legible (enough) to those doing the work of assessment to *count*. (p 45)

- [[counting]]


> It is to tell new stories, in new ways, in the academy. (p 45)

> The *unheimlich*, on the other hand, asserts (for Royle, as for Freud) the ego's inability to inhabit a position of mastery within its "own home" (vis-à-vis the unconscious). (p 46)

> It is that *thing* that erupts unpredictably into an otherwise unremarkable moment, defamiliarising it and rendering the presumed unclear. (p 46)

> ... to experience the uncanny is to always be, like a boundary object, *within* and *without* simultaneously. (p 46)

- [[boundary object]]
- [[uncanny]]


> In the Freudian uncanny, the security of a single-point perspective - intellectual certainty: I see from *here* and I see *that* - is shattered and transported into a register in which *perspectival certainty* is impossible. (p 48)

- [[perspectivism]]
- [[God-trick]]
- pretty sure [[Geoffrey Bennington]] writes, somewhere, that we always tread a path between certainty and bewilderment.


> Research-creation ... is, at its most interesting, a decidedly uncanny practice. (p 47)

- [[research-creation]]

> Etymologically, *curious* has the same root as *careful* or *curate*: to care. (p 47)

> ... when I teach Brazilian pedagogical activist and theorist Paolo Freire's work in my graduate courses I highlight the way that he draws our attention not only to conscious emotional economies (those moments when a reaction to a teacher or a text can be clearly articulated and accounted for in positive or negative terms) but also to *affective* economies - those moments when reactions and bodily instincts or drives run the pedagogical show (be it curiosity or anxiety or both in equal measure).

> ... if, in so doing, art ... is asked simply to accede to the reigning logics of the university without being allowed to remake the university through its presence, to render the university a site of potential uncanniness by rendering the familiar *unfamiliar*, then more is needed. (p 51)
